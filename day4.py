# module are basically python files and import function is used to insert a python file into another
#how to create a python module ,just simply create a file and import in into the main file 
#how to use it in the python code ,the syntax is modulename.function you want to use from the module 
# we can increase the range of floating point no by multiplying it with a number,range of floating point number is [x,y)

# list is just a set of square brackets in which items are stored.This item can be of any data type or 
# mixed data types
# why is the first item is at zero?
# it is basically shift or offset from the beginning so first item at so shift so 
# it is zero while second item is shifted by one so it's index is 1 and so on.
# we can use negative index also it means the list start counting from the end of the list
# to change the item in the list just perform:
# item_name[index_no] = "changed"
friends =["Aditi","Ayush","Nidhi"]

# append function is used to add an item in the end of the list
# extend function is used to add lot of items in the end of the list

# the len function gives the length of the list or number of characters in the string
